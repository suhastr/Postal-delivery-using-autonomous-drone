# üöÄ Drone-Based Postal Delivery System

## üìå About the Project
The **Drone-Based Postal Delivery System** is an innovative project designed to automate lightweight package deliveries using a quadcopter. By leveraging modern microcontrollers, GPS technology, and communication modules, the drone can autonomously transport goods with minimal human intervention. This project aims to enhance transportation management by reducing delivery time, fuel costs, and human labor.

## üéØ Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a drone-based delivery system capable of:
- **Autonomous flight** for delivering lightweight packages.
- **Remote-controlled operation** for precise navigation.
- **Payload handling** via a servo-controlled delivery mechanism.
- **Live location tracking** with GPS integration.

## üõ† Technologies Used
The project incorporates multiple technologies and hardware components:
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino UNO
- **Flight Controller**: Pixhawk 2.4.8
- **Programming Languages**: C/C++ (for microcontroller programming)
- **Communication Protocols**: GSM module for remote control, MAVLink for telemetry
- **Ground Station Software**: QGroundControl

## üèó Equipment & Materials Used
| Component          | Specifications |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **Drone Frame**   | 450mm frame |
| **Motors**        | Avionics 2836 (880 RPM/Volt) |
| **Propellers**    | 10cm length, 4.5cm pitch |
| **Battery**       | 4-cell, 3300mAh |
| **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)** | 40A |
| **GPS Module**    | For live tracking |
| **Radio Transmitter** | For remote control |
| **Payload Box**   | Sunmica board (10mm thickness) |
| **Servo Motor**   | For door mechanism |
| **GSM Module**    | For payload communication |

## üìñ Physics Behind the Project
The project relies on several fundamental physics principles:
- **Aerodynamics**: Lift is generated using four propellers arranged in a quadcopter formation.
- **Newton‚Äôs Third Law**: Propellers push air downwards, creating an upward lift force.
- **Torque & Stability**: Controlled via differential motor speeds.
- **Energy Management**: Efficient power distribution from the battery via ESCs.
- **Wireless Communication**: MAVLink protocol enables drone-ground station connectivity.
